Unzip in a directory. Javavis is prepared for a Eclipse project. There is an Ant
task in order to compile, run and generate the javadoc. If you are using 
another platform or even from command line, you must bear this in mind:

- All the libs in the lib directory must be included in the CLASSPATH
- The main class is javavis.Gui
