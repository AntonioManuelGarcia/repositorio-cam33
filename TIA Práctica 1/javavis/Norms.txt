Norms that must observe functions in order to be included in JavaVis
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- Function must begin with F 
- An icon of 17x17 pixels must be attached with the function, showing any related 
  feature with the function.
- An example of execution, with the original image (the test images provided with JavaVis can 
  be used) and the result one, indicating the parameters used.
- JIPException must be thrown
- The function must contain enough comentaries so that the function can be understood. 
  At the beginning of the class a generic text (in English, of course) must appear. 
  This is an example of FBinarize.
